  short: User, admin, application, network, or service sessions
  description: |-
    These fields are used to track an entity's interaction with various assets, services, and applications in an enterprise.  Sessions will typically include a start event, often a login / authorization event performed locally or via network based mechanisms, and an end event indicating a logoff or session termination.  Related events during the scope of the session will typically be associated via tuples of user, source and or destination ip/port, or cookies.

    When available, event start/end or duration fields should be populated, as well as iam, user, network, host, observer, process, source, destination, client, and server fields as appropriate to describe the specifics of the interaction.

  type: group

 fields:

   - name: kind
     level: extended
     type: keyword
     short: Session kind
     description: >
       Session kind describes the type of access represented - system (e.g. local/remote/virtual system logins to workstations, servers, appliances, etc.), application (e.g. web, ftp, database interactions), or network (VPN connections, 802.1x or NAC access to network, wireless WPA sessions).

     example: network

   - name: type
     level: extended
     type: Logical session type
     short: Session type
     description: >
       Session type fields provide additional detail on the scope of the interactions being tracked.  Initial values include local (e.g. hands on keyboard, serial connections, etc.), remote (e.g. direct system access via remote desktop, ssh, etc), virtual (e.g. VDI, VDA, etc.), and wired, wireless and vpn network connections.  Session type allows arrays to provide, if necessary, multiple values for a given interaction.

     example: wireless
     normalize:
       - array

    - name: authorization
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Authorization scope of the session. Initial values will include user (e.g. user vdi/vda, vpn, or web sessions, wired/wireless/vpn network access, etc), administrative sessions (root, VMWare Host access, router "enable" level cli, etc.) or service (e.g. network to network VPN, non-user verified application service sessions).

      example: user

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: Session Name
      description: The name field is meant to contain a locally significant identifier for the session as configured. This could represent a VPN group name, a wireless network name (ssid), a wired network segment, VDI service name, service or application identifier.

      example: HQ-Wireless

    - name: id
      level: extended
      type: Session id
      description: >
        The id field is meant to contain a locally significant identifier for the session as provided by the observer or host reporting the session.  If no id is provided this field can remain blank, or a hash function similar to network.community_id can be used to discretely identify sessions from unique values.

      example: 7635344
