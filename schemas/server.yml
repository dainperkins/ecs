- name: server
  title: Server
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the server side of a network connection, used with client.
  description: >
    A Server is defined as the responder in a network connection for events regarding sessions, connections, or bidirectional flow records.

    For TCP events, the server is the receiver of the initial SYN packet(s) of the TCP connection.
    For other protocols, the server is generally the responder in the network transaction.
    Some systems actually use the term "responder" to refer the server in TCP connections.
    The server fields describe details about the system acting as the server in the network event.
    Server fields are usually populated in conjunction with client fields.
    Server fields are generally not populated for packet-level events.

    Client / server representations can add semantic context to an exchange,
    which is helpful to visualize the data in certain situations.
    If your context falls in that category, you should still ensure that source and destination are filled appropriately.

  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Server network address.
      description: >
        Some event server addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the server.
      description: >
        IP address of the server.

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the server.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword

        MAC address of the server.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Server domain.

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the host.
      description: >
        Name of the host.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
        decides which value to use.

        In the case of fully and partially qualified domain names it is recommended to parse out 
        the additional fields of top_level_domain, registered_domain, subdomain, and hostname
        as they are available.
      example: www.east.mydomain.co.uk 
 
    # Domain Stuff
    - name: hostname
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Hostname of the system.
      description: >
        Hostname of the system.

        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine, or the
        host portion of a fully qualified domain name.
        
        For example, the hostname portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk " is "www".
      example: www

    
    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for " www.east.mydomain.co.uk " is "mydomain.co.uk".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: mydomain.co.uk

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The effective top level domain (com, org, net, co.uk).
      description: >
        The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
        is the last part of the domain name and is typically inclusive of the 
        top level domain (e.g. "co"), as well as including country code and region codes
        For example, the top level domain for www.east.mydomain.co.uk is "co.uk".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). 
      example: co.uk

    - name: subdomain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The subdomain of the domain.
      description: >
        The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except 
        the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the 
        the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of
        the names below the registered domain.
        
        For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk " is "east".

        If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
        the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
      example: east

    - name: is_internationalized
      level: extended
      type: boolean
      short: Does the domain contain punycode characters.
      description: >
        Internationalized domain names may contain non LDH-ASCII character encoding used
        to represent full unicode characters in the ASCII representation used by DNS. For example the 
        internationalized country code TLD for Israel is .xn--4dbrk0ce.

      example: false
