- name: host
  title: Host
  group: 2
  short: Fields describing the relevant computing instance.
  description: >
    A host is defined as a general computing instance.

    ECS host.* fields should be populated with details about the host on which
    the event happened, or from which the measurement was taken.
    Host types include hardware, virtual machines, Docker containers, and Kubernetes nodes.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: hostname
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Hostname of the host.
      description: >
        Hostname of the host.

        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine.

    - name: name
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the host.
      description: >
        Name of the host.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
        decides which value to use.

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Unique host id.
      description: >
        Unique host id.

        As hostname is not always unique, use values that are meaningful
        in your environment.

        Example: The current usage of `beat.name`.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      description: >
        Host ip addresses.
      normalize:
        - array

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Host mac addresses.
      normalize:
        - array

    - name: type
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Type of host.
      description: >
        Type of host.

        For Cloud providers this can be the machine type like `t2.medium`.
        If vm, this could be the container, for example, or other information
        meaningful in your environment.

    - name: uptime
      level: extended
      type: long
      example: 1325
      description: >
        Seconds the host has been up.

    - name: architecture
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: "x86_64"
      description: >
        Operating system architecture.

    - name: domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the directory the group is a member of.
      description: >
        Name of the domain of which the host is a member.

        For example, on Windows this could be the host's Active Directory domain or NetBIOS domain name.
        For Linux this could be the domain of the host's LDAP provider.
      example: CONTOSO

    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for "foo.google.com" is "google.com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: mydomain.co.uk

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The effective top level domain (com, org, net, co.uk).
      description: >
        The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
        is the last part of the domain name.
        For example, the top level domain for google.com is "com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: co.uk

    - name: subdomain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The subdomain of the domain.
      description: >
        The subdomain is all of the labels under the registered_domain in a partially qualified
        domain name, and all of the labels except the hostname in a fully qualified domain name.
        
        If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
        the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
      example: east

    - name: country_code
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The country code portion of the domain.
      description: >
        The country code portion of the domain.

      example: uk
