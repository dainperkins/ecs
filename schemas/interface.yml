  group: 2
  short: Fields to describe host interface information.
  description: >
    The interface fields describe information about the configuration of an interface on any type of
    network connected host or observer.

    Interface configuration field requirements will vary significantly depending on the type of device
    being inventoried, or the interface specific information provided in a given event.

  reusable:
    top_level: true
    expected:
      - agent
      - client
      - host
      - observer
      - server

  type: group
  fields:

    - name: id
      level: core
      type: keyword
      example: gi0/1
      description: >
        Interface ID as reported by the system.

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: GigabitEthernet0/1
      description: >
        Optional long interface name as reported by the systen.

    - name: description
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: Uplink to Core Router
      description: >
        Optional interface description as reported by the system.

    - name: enabled
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: true
      description: >
        Boolean value representing the logical state of the interface (true = enabled, false = disabled)    

    - name: status
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: connected
      description: >
        Interface logical connection state as reported by the system. Possible values are connected, not-connected, error-disabled

    - name: speed
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: 1000
      description: >
        Interface speed as reported by the system in megabits per second.  

    - name: duplex
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: full
      description: >
        Interface duplex setting as reported by the system.  Acceptable values are full and half

    - name: negotiation
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: true
      description: >
        Set this value to true if the interface is set for autonegotiation

    - name: bandwidth
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      example: 1000
      description: >
        Some interfaces, particularly in networking devices, have a bandwidth setting that is used to define the logical
        bandwidth available on a physical link when it differs from the physical media.  Record that value in this field.
