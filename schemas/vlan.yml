  short: Fields to describe observed VLAN information.
  description: >
    The VLAN fields are used to identify 802.1q tag(s) of a packet, as well as ingress and
    egress VLAN associations of an observer in relation to a specific packet or connection.
    
    Network.vlan fields are used to record a single VLAN tag for a packet or connection
    as observed, typically provided by a network sensor (e.g. Zeek, Wireshark) passively
    reporting on traffic.

    Network.inner and network.outer VLAN fields are used to report q-in-q 802.1q tags (multiple
    802.1q encapsulations) as observed, typically provided by a network sensor  (e.g. Zeek, 
    Wireshark) passively reporting on traffic.

    Observer.ingress and observer.egress VLAN values are used to record observer specific 
    information when observer events contain discrete ingress and egress VLAN information, 
    typically provided by firewalla, routera, or load balancers.
