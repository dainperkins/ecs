    or hosts are providing relevant information in events (e.g. netflow, firewall logs, host and network
    metrics, etc.)

  fields:

    - name: id

      short: 802.1q VLAN ID
      example: 10
      description: >
        VLAN ID of the congfigured VLAN. Expoected values are 0 to 4095, with 0 and 4095 typically being

        Maximum tranmission unit is the maximum size of packets provcessed in this VLAN.  
        This value will typically be in the range of 68 - 9216, with 1400-1500 and 9216 being
        the most likely.

      type: keyword
      short: Current VLAN state
