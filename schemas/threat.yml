  short: Fields describing detected or reported threats
  description: >
    ECS threat fields are used to categorize security events based on the technique and tactic of a given threat observed or reported to the system.
    A typical implementation would utilize an internal or public threat classification taxonomy like the Mitre ATT&CK framework to enrich tuned IDS,
    NGFW, or other threat detection alerts with the relevant classification data.

  type: group
  fields:

    - name: framework
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Threat classification framework.
      description: >
        Name of the threat framework used to further categorize and classify the tactic and technique of the reported threat.  
        Framework classification can be provided by detecting systems, evaluated at ingest time, or retrospectively tagged to events.

      example: MITRE ATT&CK
