- name: destination
  title: Destination
  group: 2
  short: Fields about the destination side of a network connection, used with source.
  description: >
    Destination fields describe details about the destination of a packet/event.

    Destination fields are usually populated in conjunction with source fields.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Destination network address.
      description: >
        Some event destination addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the destination.
      description: >
        IP address of the destination.

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the destination.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        MAC address of the destination.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Destination domain.

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the destination system.
      description: >
        Name of the destination system.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
        decides which value to use.

        In the case of fully and partially qualified domain names it is recommended to parse out 
        the additional fields of top_level_domain, registered_domain, subdomain, and hostname
        as they are available.
      example: www.east.mydomain.co.uk 
 
    # Domain Stuff
    - name: hostname
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Hostname of the system.
      description: >
        Hostname of the system.

        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine, or the
        host portion of a fully qualified domain name.
      example: www
    
    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for " www.east.mydomain.co.uk " is "mydomain.co.uk".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: mydomain.co.uk

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The effective top level domain (com, org, net, co.uk).
      description: >
        The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
        is the last part of the domain name and is typically inclusive of the 
        top level domain (e.g. "co"), as well as including country code and region codes
        For example, the top level domain for www.east.mydomain.co.uk is "co.uk".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). 
      example: co.uk

    - name: subdomain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The subdomain of the domain.
      description: >
        The subdomain portion of a fully qualified domain name includes all of the names except 
        the host name under the registered_domain.  In a partially qualified domain, or if the 
        the qualification level of the full name cannot be determined, subdomain contains all of
        the names below the registered domain.
        
        For example the subdomain portion of "www.east.mydomain.co.uk " is "east".

        If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
        the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
      example: east

    - name: is_internationalized
      level: extended
      type: boolean
      short: Does the domain contain punycode characters.
      description: >
        Internationalized domain names may contain non LDH-ASCII character encoding used
        to represent full unicode characters in the ASCII representation used by DNS. For example the 
        internationalized country code TLD for Israel is .xn--4dbrk0ce.

      example: false

      short: Destination NAT ip
      description: >
        Translated ip of destination based NAT sessions (e.g. internet to private DMZ)

        Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers.

    - name: nat.port
      format: string
      level: extended
      type: long
      short: Destination NAT Port

        Typically used with load balancers, firewalls, or routers.
