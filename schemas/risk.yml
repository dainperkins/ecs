  short: Risk Scores and Tags for prioritization and categorization of events and signals.
  description: >
    Risk fields represent the normalized comparative sensitivity of internal resources or the potential risk of
    threats, vulnerabilities, and IOCs.

    At the event level, normalized risk is calculated based on any risk metrics available for lookup for the
    given event (e.g. a user, source, destination in a firewall log, a client and file in a endpoint file/process
    log). The final event score is calculated by summing the squares of each avaialble risk score and dividing by
    the total multiple of available scores. As an example:  ( user.risk^2 + source.risk^2 + destination.risk^2 ) / ( user.risk + source.risk + destination.risk )

    Risk labels are for labeling the type of business risk represented by a given resource, typically in reference to the data
    housed in an asset or zone, the level of access of a given user or group, or the risk represented by a given threat or IOC.

      description: one or more locally relevant tags to describe the risk type of asset or data identified either 
        specific to e.g. a local data classification system, network zone, or regulatory/compliance applicability

      example: public, private, confidential, PCI, CFR21p11, PII, SOX, GDPR

      level: extended
      type: long
      description: comparative risk score on a normalized scale of 0-10, quantitavely scoring the level 
        of risk of the asset or data, or the risk represented by a given threat (typically provided by the 
        observer or IOC provider)

      example: 5
