  short: Risk Scores and Labels
  description: >
    Risk fields represent the normalized comparative sensitivity of internal resources or the potential risk of threats, vulnerabilities, and IOCs.

    At the event level normalized risk is calculated based on any risk metrics available for lookup for the given event
    (e.g. a user, source, destination in a firewall log, a client and file in a endpoint file/process log). The final event score
    is calculated by summing the squares of each avaialble risk score and dividing by the total multiple of available scores.
    As an example:  ( user.risk + source.risk + destination.risk ) / ( user.risk + source.risk + destination.risk )

    Risk labels are for labeling the type of business risk represented by a given resource, typically in reference to the data
    housed in an asset or zone, the level of access of a given user or group, or the risk represented by a given threat or IOC.
