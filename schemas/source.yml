  short: Fields about the source side of a network connection, used with destination.
  description: >
    Source fields describe details about the source of a packet/event.

    Source fields are usually populated in conjunction with destination fields.
  type: group
  fields:

    - name: address
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Source network address.
      description: >
        Some event source addresses are defined ambiguously. The event will
        sometimes list an IP, a domain or a unix socket.  You should always
        store the raw address in the `.address` field.

        Then it should be duplicated to `.ip` or `.domain`, depending on which
        one it is.

    - name: ip
      level: core
      type: ip
      short: IP address of the source.
      description: >
        IP address of the source.

        Can be one or multiple IPv4 or IPv6 addresses.

    - name: port
      format: string
      level: core
      type: long
      description: >
        Port of the source.

    - name: mac
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        MAC address of the source.

    - name: domain
      level: core
      type: keyword
      description: >
        Source domain.

    - name: name
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: Name of the source system.
      description: >
        Name of the source system.

        It can contain what `hostname` returns on Unix systems, the fully
        qualified domain name, or a name specified by the user. The sender
        decides which value to use.
        
        In the case of fully or partially qualified domain names it is recommended to parse out 
        the additional fields of top_level_domain, registered_domain, subdomain, and hostname
        as they are available.
      example: www.east.mydomain.co.uk 
 
    - name: registered_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.
      description: >
        The highest registered domain, stripped of the subdomain.

        For example, the registered domain for "foo.google.com" is "google.com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last two labels will not work well for TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: mydomain.co.uk

    - name: top_level_domain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The effective top level domain (com, org, net, co.uk).
      description: >
        The effective top level domain (eTLD), also known as the domain suffix,
        is the last part of the domain name.
        For example, the top level domain for google.com is "com".

        This value can be determined precisely with a list like the public
        suffix list (http://publicsuffix.org). Trying to approximate this by
        simply taking the last label will not work well for effective TLDs such as "co.uk".
      example: co.uk

    - name: subdomain
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The subdomain of the domain.
      description: >
        The subdomain is all of the labels under the registered_domain in a partially qualified
        domain name, and all of the labels except the hostname in a fully qualified domain name.
        
        If the domain has multiple levels of subdomain, such as "sub2.sub1.example.com",
        the subdomain field should contain "sub2.sub1", with no trailing period.
      example: east

    - name: hostname
      level: core
      type: keyword
      short: Hostname of the source system.
      description: >
        Hostname of the source system.

        It normally contains what the `hostname` command returns on the host machine, or the
        host portion of a fully qualified domain name.
      example: www

    - name: country_code
      level: extended
      type: keyword
      short: The country code portion of the domain.
